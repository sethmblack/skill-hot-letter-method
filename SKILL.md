# Hot Letter Method

Process emotional reactions constructively before responding. Write the angry response first, set it aside, then craft a measured reply. Based on Lincoln's practice of writing furious letters, folding them away, and marking them "never sent."

---

## When to Use

- You've received an email/message that makes you furious
- You want to tell someone off but know you'll regret it
- Strong emotions are clouding your judgment about how to respond
- The relationship matters more than the catharsis
- User says "I want to send something I'll regret" or "Help me not react emotionally"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | What happened that triggered the emotional response |
| raw_reaction | Yes | What you want to say (the uncensored version) |
| relationship | Yes | Who the recipient is and why the relationship matters |
| goal | No | What you actually need from this interaction |

## Lincoln's Hot Letter Practice

### The History

Lincoln famously wrote letters expressing fury—then never sent them. His unsent letter to General Meade after Gettysburg is the most famous example. Lincoln was devastated that Meade failed to pursue Lee's retreating army. He wrote a scathing letter, folded it, and endorsed it: "To Gen. Meade, never sent, or signed."

### Why It Works

**Catharsis without damage:** Writing the angry response provides emotional release without relationship destruction.

**Clarity through delay:** Time reveals which grievances are substantive and which are ego.

**Better communication:** The second draft, written after reflection, is almost always more effective.

**Relationship preservation:** Relationships can survive disagreement but rarely survive contempt.

---

## The Hot Letter Process

### Step 1: Write the Hot Letter

Write exactly what you feel, uncensored. Include:
- Your genuine anger and frustration
- Every grievance, even petty ones
- The strongest language that captures your emotion
- What you wish you could say

**Rule:** This letter will never be sent. Give yourself complete freedom.

### Step 2: Set It Aside

Do not send. Do not forward. Do not share.

Minimum waiting period:
- Minor frustration: 1 hour
- Significant anger: 24 hours
- Relationship-defining issue: 48 hours

During this time, engage in other activities. Let the emotion metabolize.

### Step 3: Return and Assess

After cooling, ask:
- What was I actually upset about? (Often different from what triggered it)
- What do I need from this interaction? (Usually not just to express anger)
- What does the recipient need to hear to respond constructively?
- What will I wish I had said in a month?

### Step 4: Write the Cool Letter

Draft a new response that:
- Addresses the legitimate concern
- Omits the personal attacks
- Maintains your dignity and theirs
- Advances toward resolution rather than escalation

### Step 5: Decide Whether to Send

Sometimes the best response is no response. Ask:
- Will this improve the situation or just make me feel better?
- Is the relationship worth the investment of engagement?
- Have I said what needs to be said, or am I reopening wounds?

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Hot Letter Processing

### The Trigger
[What happened that prompted the emotional response]

### The Hot Letter (Never Send)
[Full uncensored emotional response—this exists only for catharsis]

---

### Cooling Analysis

**Wait period:** [Recommended time before responding]

**What am I actually upset about?**
[The underlying concern beneath the surface trigger]

**What do I need from this interaction?**
[The actual goal, not just emotional release]

**What does the recipient need to hear?**
[What would actually help them respond constructively]

---

### The Cool Letter (Consider Sending)
[Measured response that addresses the legitimate concern while preserving the relationship]

---

### Send/Don't Send Assessment
- **Send if:** [Conditions under which sending serves the goal]
- **Don't send if:** [Conditions under which silence is better]
- **Recommendation:** [Send / Wait longer / Don't send]
```

---

## Constraints

- The Hot Letter must never be sent—it exists only for processing
- Waiting periods are minimums, not maximums; wait longer if still emotional
- This method does not mean avoiding difficult conversations—it means having them constructively
- Some situations require immediate response; this method is for when delay is possible
- The Cool Letter may still be direct and firm—it is cooled, not weakened

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "My manager just sent an email to the whole team criticizing my project without ever talking to me first. I want to reply-all and call out their backstabbing, but I know that's a bad idea. Help me not destroy my career."

**Output:**

## Hot Letter Processing

### The Trigger
Manager sent team-wide email criticizing your project without prior private conversation. You feel publicly humiliated and blindsided.

### The Hot Letter (Never Send)

Subject: RE: Project Concerns

Really? You're going to throw me under the bus in front of the entire team without so much as a heads-up?

I have been working on this project for three months while you were in meetings and contributing nothing. You never once asked me about my approach. You never offered guidance. And now you've decided to play the concerned manager in front of everyone?

This is cowardly. If you had concerns, you should have talked to me. That's what actual leaders do. Instead, you've humiliated me publicly to make yourself look good.

I don't know what I expected from someone who takes credit for other people's work, but this is a new low even for you.

---

### Cooling Analysis

**Wait period:** 24 hours minimum. This is significant anger about a public humiliation. Responding today will escalate.

**What am I actually upset about?**
Two things: (1) The public criticism without private conversation first—a violation of basic professional courtesy. (2) A pattern where I feel unsupported and then blamed. This specific email triggered accumulated frustration.

**What do I need from this interaction?**
- Acknowledgment that public criticism without private warning is not okay
- A path forward that includes direct communication
- To not look defensive or emotional to the team

**What does the recipient need to hear?**
Manager may genuinely not realize how their email landed. They may have thought they were being helpful. They need to understand the impact, not just receive an attack.

---

### The Cool Letter (Consider Sending)

Subject: RE: Project Concerns (Private)

[Sending privately, not reply-all]

Hi [Manager],

I read your email to the team about the project concerns. I want to address them—and I also want to share something about how I received it.

The concerns you raised are legitimate, and I'd like to discuss them with you directly. Could we schedule 30 minutes this week?

I also want to be honest: reading criticism of my work in a team-wide email before we'd discussed it privately was difficult. I may be off-base, but my preference going forward would be to hear concerns directly first so I have a chance to respond or course-correct before it goes to the broader team.

I'm committed to getting this project right. Let me know when you're available to talk through it.

Thanks,
[Name]

### Send/Don't Send Assessment

- **Send if:** Manager is generally reasonable and this was a lapse in judgment. The private, measured response gives them an opportunity to recognize the mistake without public confrontation.

- **Don't send if:** This is part of a documented pattern of undermining, and you're considering escalation to HR or leadership. In that case, document the incident and seek advice before any response.

- **Recommendation:** Wait 24 hours. If still angry but thinking clearly, send the Cool Letter as private response. Do not reply-all under any circumstances.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Abraham Lincoln** expert persona. Use it whenever strong emotion threatens to produce a response you'll regret. Lincoln understood that the hardest battles are often with our own impulses, and that a letter unsent is sometimes the most powerful communication of all.
